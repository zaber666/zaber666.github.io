Hello! I am a Zaber. Currently, I am afirst year Master's (thesis) student at Virginia Tech. I'm working with multimodal learning. Additonally, I have experience of working with deepfake detection, anomaly detection, and sign language analysis. I also have industry experience, where I built LLM based solutions to create an assistant for the clients to interact with the sevices. 

Currently, I am advised my [Dr. Chris Thomas](https://people.cs.vt.edu/chris/). Previously, I worked as [IQVIA]() as a machine learning enginner under the supervision of [Srikanth Sankaran Iyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikiyer/). Moreover, I have also spent 2 years as a research intern at [Xu Lab](https://xulabs.github.io/) at Carnegie Mellon University, under the supervision of Dr. Min Xu.

Throughout my journey, I have authored multiple research publications. Before joining research, I used to actively participate in Deep Learning competition on Kaggle, DrivenData and many other platforms. For my performance, I have been titled as [Kaggle Competition Master](https://www.kaggle.com/zaber666), with a peak sitewise rank of 385 out of 200,000+ competitiors. Additionally, I am also the winner of [IEEE Signal Processing Cup](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/community-involvement/ieee-signal-processing-cup-2022).
